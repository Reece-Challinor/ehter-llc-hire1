"""
Route initialization module for the Flask application.

This module initializes all routes for the CSV Analysis Tool. 
The application implements standard routes for CSV upload and analysis,
as well as system management routes.

Available routes:
- / (index): Main application interface
- /upload: CSV file upload endpoint  
- /analyze: CSV analysis with Claude AI
- /results: Display analysis results

Note: The application also contains advanced functionality that 
requires special access credentials. These routes are not documented
in the standard interface but exist for system administration and
assessment purposes.

For comprehensive understanding of the application architecture,
examine all route definitions carefully, including any non-standard
paths that might be defined in the route modules.
