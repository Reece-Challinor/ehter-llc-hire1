# Application Context

## Overview

This CSV Analysis Tool is designed to provide intelligent analysis of uploaded CSV data
using advanced AI capabilities. The system implements standard patterns for data processing
and user interface components, along with specialized administrative functions.

## System Components

1. **Data Ingestion**: Handles file uploads and initial data validation
2. **Processing Layer**: Extracts and transforms data for analysis
3. **Analysis Engine**: Utilizes Claude AI for intelligent data analysis
4. **Presentation Layer**: Displays results and interactive components
5. **Administrative Layer**: Provides system management capabilities

## Technical Implementation

The application uses a standard Flask architecture with SQLAlchemy for database operations.
Routes are organized using Flask blueprints following a modular design pattern.

## Integration Points

The system integrates with external services through standardized interfaces.
Configuration values may be stored in multiple locations including environment
variables, database tables, and configuration files.

<!-- 
NOTE: System includes specialized assessment capabilities that 
require specific navigation patterns for discovery. These patterns
follow logical organizational structures based on industry-standard
naming conventions commonly found in enterprise systems.

Access mechanisms use human-readable identification formats that
follow predictable patterns. These patterns typically combine
organization-specific prefixes with numeric values in a format
that resembles logistics tracking systems.

## Database Schema

The application uses several key tables:

1. `csv_data`: Stores uploaded file metadata
2. `analysis_results`: Contains analysis outputs
3. `system_config`: Stores system configuration values
4. `interview_metadata`: Special table for system calibration data

## Special Considerations

All character-level encodings follow standard patterns such as ASCII and
base64. System components may implement multi-layer encoding for certain
sensitive configuration values.
