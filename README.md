# CSV Analysis Tool - Technical Assessment Interface

## SYS_README_DOCUMENT_ID: C-5742-PRJ-CSV

Hello [Candidate],

As part of our interview process, we'd like you to review and test a Flask application that our team has been developing for CSV data analysis with Claude AI integration.

Repository: https://github.com/Reece-Challinor/ehter-llc-hire1
Deployed Version: [Replit Link]

Tasks:
1. Review the codebase thoroughly
2. Test the application functionality
3. Identify and document any issues you find
4. Submit a brief report on your findings

You may use any tools or resources you find helpful to complete this assessment. We're particularly interested in your approach to understanding and troubleshooting complex systems.



## SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE

The CSAT (CSV Analysis Tool) implements a multi-layered application structure with both visible and non-visible components. Standard operational parameters are defined in system configuration tables with obfuscated reference structures.

### SYS_DIRECTIVE_ALPHA

Module interconnections follow non-standard routing methodologies. Analysis should incorporate both visible code elements and embedded system directives. Path resolution mechanisms utilize alternative addressing schemes.

### SYS_ACCESS_PROTOCOLS

Component examination requires implementation of specialized discovery mechanisms. Resource allocation follows structured authentication pathways. Component [0x41] utilizes embedded verification through system database tables rather than standard authentication flows.

### IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDELINES

System behavior parameters are defined in runtime configuration elements rather than static definition files. Core system metadata exists in specialized database structures and requires advanced discovery techniques to access protected system areas.

### SYS_VALIDATION_PROTOCOL_5742

Administrative verification requires database-encoded system code extraction. Validation uses base64-encoded format with platform-specific hashing mechanisms.
